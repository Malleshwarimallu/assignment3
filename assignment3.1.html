<h1>Assignment 3.1</h1>
<h2>WEB DEVELOPMENT</h2>
<!-- css style contains font family of segoe script-->
<p id='para1'>Web development is a broad term for the work involved in developing a web site for the 
Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network). 
Web development can range from developing the simplest static single page of plain text to the 
most complex web-based internet applications
 electronic businesses, and social network services</p>
<!-- css style contains font size of 350 pixel-->
<p id='para2'>
The objective of designing a site is to ensure that when the users open up the site they see the information in a format that is easy to read and relevant.
</p>
<!-- css style contains font colour blue-->
<p id='para3'>They need to ensure that their site comes up correctly in different browsers (cross-browser), different operating systems (cross-platform) and different devices (cross-device), which requires careful planning on the side of the developer.</p>
<!-- css style contains word spacing-->
<p id='para4'>This is further complicated by the fact that users now use a large variety of devices with varying screen sizes and resolutions thus forcing the designer to take into consideration these aspects when designing the site</p>
<!-- css style contains letter spacing-->
<p id='para5'>There are several tools available that can be used to develop the front end of a website, and understanding which tools are best fit for specific tasks marks the difference between developing a hacked site and a well designed, scalable site</p>
